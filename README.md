# eozin

**A Rust library to read digital pathology images**

Eozin is a pure Rust library intended to work on several environments such as web browsers via WASM, and Python.

This project is heavily under development and experimental.

Currently, [Python bindings](python/README.md) works on Ubuntu 22.04 for Aperio SVS files.

The name "eozin" is named after fluorescent dye eosin widely used in pathology.
